# Miwok-Learning-App
This app allows the users to learn the Miwok language using an interactive android app which makes use of basic multi screening, audio managers, imageviews, listviews, custom adapters while also following material design guidelines and best coding practices for android.

This app was made for learning purposes and it implements arrays, lists, loops and custom classes in java. The one really useful thing to gather from this is the use of a custom adapter to save memory and how to properly use audio manager.

All the colours and designs in the app also follow material design guidelines and good coding practices for android.
